The example for 'w_existing_load_balancer' is excluded from end-to-end testing.

Reason:
- Requires an existing Standard Load Balancer and frontend IP configuration
- The inputvalue for the existing Standard Load Balancer and frontend IP configuration resource id URL
- Cannot be reliably provisioned in automated CI pipelines
- Intended as a reference example only
